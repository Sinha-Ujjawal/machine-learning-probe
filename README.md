# Machine Learning Probe
This is a repository for me to learn [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) once and for all. I plan to use it as a playground to learn about different ML algorithms, and test out some library, learn, etc.

## Disclaimer ⚠️
It should be obvious to not take any of this seriously and use any of the code snippets from here in production. But if you do so, you are on your own.
